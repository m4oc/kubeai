from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="ignored",
                base_url="http://kubeai/openai/v1")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gemma2-2b-cpu",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
  ]
